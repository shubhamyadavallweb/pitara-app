# 📊 Real-Time Payment Monitoring in Supabase

## 🎯 **YES! You can see payments in real-time just like authentication!**

With the payment tracking system I implemented, you now have **full visibility** into payments - exactly like you see authentication events in Supabase.

## 🔍 **Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)**

### **Step-by-Step:**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **"Table Editor"** in the sidebar  
3. Select **"payments"** table (new table I created)
4. **🎉 You'll see ALL payments in real-time!**

### **What You'll See:**
```
| user_email              | plan_id | amount | status | created_at           |
|------------------------|---------|--------|--------|---------------------|
| shubham.1614@gmail.com | trial   | 9900   | paid   | 2025-06-14 08:56:07 |
| user2@email.com        | starter | 14900  | paid   | 2025-06-14 09:15:23 |
| user3@email.com        | popular | 19900  | created| 2025-06-14 09:30:45 |
```

**Real-Time Updates:** Just like `auth.users` table, this refreshes automatically when new payments come in!

## 📱 **Method 2: Code-Based Real-Time Monitoring**

### **Real-Time Payment Subscription:**
```javascript
import { supabase } from '@/integrations/supabase/client';

// Set up real-time payment monitoring
const channel = supabase
  .channel('payment-monitor')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*', // All events (INSERT, UPDATE)
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'payments'
  }, (payload) => {
    if (payload.eventType === 'INSERT') {
      const newPayment = payload.new;
      console.log(`💰 NEW PAYMENT: ₹${newPayment.amount / 100} from ${newPayment.user_email}`);
      
      // Update your UI, send notifications, etc.
    }
    
    if (payload.eventType === 'UPDATE') {
      const updatedPayment = payload.new;
      if (updatedPayment.status === 'paid') {
        console.log(`✅ PAYMENT COMPLETED: ₹${updatedPayment.amount / 100}`);
      }
    }
  })
  .subscribe();
```

## 📈 **Method 3: Admin Dashboard Integration**

Add to your admin panel for comprehensive monitoring:

```tsx
// PaymentStats Component
const PaymentStats = () => {
  const [stats, setStats] = useState({
    totalRevenue: 0,
    todaysPayments: 0,
    pendingPayments: 0
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    // Real-time subscription to update stats
    const channel = supabase
      .channel('payment-stats')
      .on('postgres_changes', {
        event: '*',
        schema: 'public',
        table: 'payments'
      }, () => {
        // Recalculate stats when payments change
        fetchPaymentStats();
      })
      .subscribe();

    return () => supabase.removeChannel(channel);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      <Card>
        <CardContent>
          <h3>Total Revenue</h3>
          <p className="text-2xl">₹{stats.totalRevenue}</p>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
      {/* More stats... */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 🛠️ **Database Queries for Analysis**

### **Daily Revenue:**
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as payment_count,
  SUM(amount)/100 as revenue_rupees
FROM payments 
WHERE status = 'paid'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### **Top Paying Users:**
```sql
SELECT 
  user_email,
  COUNT(*) as payment_count,
  SUM(amount)/100 as total_paid
FROM payments 
WHERE status = 'paid'
GROUP BY user_email
ORDER BY total_paid DESC;
```

### **Plan Popularity:**
```sql
SELECT 
  plan_id,
  COUNT(*) as subscriptions,
  SUM(amount)/100 as revenue
FROM payments 
WHERE status = 'paid'
GROUP BY plan_id
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

## 🚨 **Real-Time Alerts**

Set up notifications for important events:

```javascript
// Example: Slack notification for new payments
const channel = supabase
  .channel('payment-alerts')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: 'UPDATE',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'payments',
    filter: 'status=eq.paid'
  }, async (payload) => {
    const payment = payload.new;
    
    // Send to Slack, Discord, email, etc.
    await fetch('YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        text: `💰 New Payment: ₹${payment.amount/100} from ${payment.user_email} for ${payment.plan_id} plan`
      })
    });
  })
  .subscribe();
```

## 📊 **Payment Status Meanings**

| Status | Description | Action Needed |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `created` | Payment order created, awaiting payment | Monitor - user might complete soon |
| `paid` | ✅ Payment successful, subscription activated | None - all good! |
